# NexeLang
This is the main repository for the **NexeLang** or **NeXeLang**, pronounce however you prefer.
While NeXeLang (New Executable Language) itself is **not open source**, this repository will not contain core components or source code related to the language.
Instead repo will be used to share **ready-to-use tools**, such as IDEs, DLL extensions, and utilities related to the language.
Nevertheless, NexeLang already provides enough tools to let you build DLL extensions, EXE demons, libraries, and even full applications.

Stay tuned for updates, releases, and development progress!
